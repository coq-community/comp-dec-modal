  Constructive proofs of soundness and completeness for K, K*, CTL,
  PDL, and PDL with converse

description: |-
  This project presents machine-checked constructive proofs of
  soundness, completeness, decidability, and the small-model property
  for the logics K, K*, CTL, and PDL (with and without converse).

  For all considered logics, we prove soundness and completeness of
  their respective Hilbert-style axiomatization. For K, K*, and CTL,
  we also prove soundness and completeness for Gentzen systems (i.e.,
  sequent calculi).

  For each logic, the central construction is a pruning-based
  algorithm computing for a given formula either a satisfying model of
  bounded size or a proof of its negation. The completeness and
  decidability results then follow with soundness from the existence
  of said algorithm.

  ## Documentation
  
  The developments for the individual logics are described in the
  publications listed above. The developments on K, K*, and CTL are
  described in the author's PhD thesis titled "A Machine-Checked
  Constructive Metatheory of Computation Tree Logic". The developments
  on PDL and PDL with converse are described in the CPP'18 paper.

  ### Structure

  - The directory `libs` contains infrastructure shared between the
    developments. This includes:
    - `fset.v`: a library for finite sets over types with a choice operator (a precursor of [finmap](https://github.com/math-comp/finmap)).
    - `fset_tac.v`: rudimentary automation for the above (originally implemented by [Alexander Anisimov](https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~anisimov/bachelor.php)).
    - `modular_hilbert.v`: a library for constructing proofs in Hilbert axiomatizations for modal logics.
    - `sltype.v`: generic lemmas for alpha/beta decomposition of modal-logic formulas.
  - the remaining directories contain the formalizations for the respective logics.
