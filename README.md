This project presents machine-checked constructive proofs of
soundness, completeness, decidability, and the small-model property
for the logics K, K*, CTL, and PDL (with and without converse).

For all considered logics, we prove soundness and completeness of
their respective Hilbert-style axiomatization. For K, K*, and CTL,
we also prove soundness and completeness for Gentzen systems (i.e.,
sequent calculi).

For each logic, the central construction is a pruning-based
algorithm computing for a given formula either a satisfying model of
bounded size or a proof of its negation. The completeness and
decidability results then follow with soundness from the existence
of said algorithm.

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Completeness and Decidability of Modal Logic Calculi
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-comp-dec-modal
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/coq-community/comp-dec-modal.git
cd comp-dec-modal
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
make install
```


## Documentation

The developments for the individual logics are described in the
publications listed above. The developments on K, K*, and CTL are
described in the author's PhD thesis titled "A Machine-Checked
Constructive Metatheory of Computation Tree Logic". The developments
on PDL and PDL with converse are described in the CPP'18 paper.

### Structure

- The directory `libs` contains infrastructure shared between the
  developments. This includes:
  - `fset.v`: a library for finite sets over types with a choice operator (a precursor of [finmap](https://github.com/math-comp/finmap)).
  - `fset_tac.v`: rudimentary automation for the above (originally implemented by [Alexander Anisimov](https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~anisimov/bachelor.php)).
  - `modular_hilbert.v`: a library for constructing proofs in Hilbert axiomatizations for modal logics.
  - `sltype.v`: generic lemmas for alpha/beta decomposition of modal-logic formulas.
- the remaining directories contain the formalizations for the respective logics.
